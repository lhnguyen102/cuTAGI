## What is cuTAGI ?
cuTAGI is an open-source Bayesian neural networks library that is based on Tractable Approximate Gaussian Inference (TAGI) theory. cuTAGI includes several of the common neural network layer architectures such as full-connected, convolutional, and transpose convolutional layers, as well as skip connections, pooling and normalization layers. cuTAGI is capable of performing different tasks such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. The library includes some of the advanced features such as the capacity to propagate uncertainties from the input to the output layer using the the [full covariance mode for hidden layers](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume22/20-1009/20-1009.pdf), the capacity to estimate the [derivative](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume23/21-0758/21-0758.pdf) of a neural network, and the capacity to quantify heteroscedastic aleatory uncertainty. 

cuTAGI is under development and new features will be added as they are ready. Currently supported tasks are:
* Supervised learning
  * Regression
  * Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  * Classification using fully-connected, convolutional and residual architectures
* Unsupervised learning
  * Autoencoders
 
Coming soon...
* Unsupervised learning: GANs
* Reinforcement learning: DQN

## Prerequisites for Local Installation
* Compiler with C++14 support
* CMake>=3.23
* CUDA toolkit (optional)

## `pytagi` Installation 
`pytagi` is a Python wrapper of C++/CUDA backend for TAGI method. The developers can install either  [distributed](#pypi-installation) or [local](#local-installation) versions of `pytagi`. Currently `pytagi` only supports Python version >=3.9 on both MacOS and Ubuntu. 

### Create Miniconda Environment
We recommend installing miniconda for managing Python environment, yet `pytagi` works well with other alternatives.
1. Install miniconda by following these [instructions](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#system-requirements) 
2. Create a conda environment
    ```
    conda create --name your_env_name python=3.10
    ```
3. Activate conda environment
    ```
    conda activate your_env_name
    ```

### PyPI Installation
1. [Create conda environment](#create-conda-environment)
2. Install requirements
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Install `pytagi`
    ```
    pip install pytagi
    ```
4. Test `pytagi` package
    ```sh
    python -m python_examples.regression_runner
    ```
NOTE: This PyPI distributed version does not require the codebase in this repository. The developers can create their own applications (see [python_examples](python_examples)).

### Local Installation
1. Clone this repository. Note that `git submodule` command allows cloning [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) which is the binding python package of C++/CUDA.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/lhnguyen102/cuTAGI.git
    cd cuTAGI
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```
2. [Create conda environment](#create-conda-environment)
4. Install requirements
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Install `pytagi` package
    ```sh
    pip install .
    ```
6. Test `pytagi` package
    ```sh
    python -m python_examples.regression_runner
    ```

## `cutagi` Installation
`cutagi` is the native version implemented in C++/CUDA for TAGI method. We highly recommend installing cuTAGI using Docker method to facilitate the installation.
